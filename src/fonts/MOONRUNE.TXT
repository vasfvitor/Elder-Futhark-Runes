MoonRune truetype font v1.0
---------------------------

This truetype-font was created in 1995 by Morten Bek.

It is supposed to resemble the writings on the maps from The Hobbit, by
J.R.R.Tolkien.

If you have any comments, corrections, suggestions or questions, e-mail me at:
bek@post3.tele.dk

Note that this is _not_ the Cirth (Certhar) but the letters used on the cover
of The Hobbit.

To install in a windows environment, copy the file futhark.ttf to 
\windows\system or \windows\fonts, depending on the Windows version you're
running. Choose Install New Font under the Font options in your Control Panel
(or confront your windows-manual if this is totally incromprehendible).

Please keep this file with the font, whenever you copy it and spread it to
your friends.

More fonts are under way....
